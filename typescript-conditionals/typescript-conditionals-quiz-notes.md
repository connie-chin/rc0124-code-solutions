- Give 6 examples of comparison operators.
  > < >= <= == !=

  boolean
- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?
  checks to see that if a condition in the parentheses is true, if it is, it executes a block of code
- Is `else` required in order to use an `if` statement?
  no, only use when you want a code block to execute if the condition is falsy
- Describe the syntax (structure) of an `if` statement.
  if (condition ) {
  code block;
  }
- What are the three logical operators?
  ||=or &&=and !=not ??= nullish.. can use w any type not just boolean
- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?
  with logical operators? && and ||
- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?
  evalutates an expression, matching the expressions value against a series of case clauses and executes statements after the first case clause with a matching value, until a break statement is encountered. kind of like starting a function before w if statements. case is teh if and else if, default is the else.
- Is a `default` clause required in order to use a `switch` statement?
  no, but if you want to use it- can only have one per switch statement and it would execute if the value of expression doesnt match any of the case clauses. its like the else in an if statement.
